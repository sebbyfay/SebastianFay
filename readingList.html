            <h3>Reading List</h3>
            <p>
                I love to read, although, like most, I don't think I read enough.
                I started reading books again about 3 years ago to kill time at
                my slow summer job. I read almost exclusively non-fiction books
                and I try to reach a book each month (with about a 60% success rate).
            </p>
            <p>
                I think its important to approach each book with an open mind, and
                be willing to have your opinions and perspectives changed. I find
                that reading non-fiction often entails navigating the differing ideas
                from well qualified and celebrated authors, which I love. With every
                book I read I concede that everything I know on a given topic
                might be wrong, and I open myself up to the ideas and findings of
                the author, while maintaining the stance that they might also be wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the books that I have read, and some that I intend to read
                soon. There is no order to this list.
